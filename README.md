# Tributit Unity SDK

This repository contains an implementation with a simple interface designed to easily communicate with the REST API of the Tributit service in your Unity Game.

Also included are files for the creation of a test project for debugging purposes.

## Setup

To use the Unity SDK in your game, all you need to do is copy the contents of the `/Assets/Scripts/TributitSDK/` folder in this repository into your game project.

## Start tracking

The SDK currently enables you to notify the Tributit server that a **player** with the supplied `player_token` (which can be any unique identifier of the player, for instance her Steam Id) has triggered an **event** (for instance the installation of your game).

Upon recieving this event the Tributit server identifies your game using a `game_token` (this is unique identifier of your game generated by the Tributit server during the registration process) and internally attempts to attribute the **player** to one of the running **campaigns** for your game.

Include this line of code in the place in your project's code, where you wish to track the **event**:

```
Tributit.Tributit.Track(game_token, player_token);
```

Where `game_token` and `player_token` are of type `string`.

## How it works?

When called, the SDK sends a HTTP request to the REST API of the Tributit server.

## Callbacks

You can add an event handler by extending the supplied `Tributit.Callback` interface and implementing both its methods.

If a request attempt succeeds, the method `void success(WWW www)` is called and if it fails the method `void error(WWW www)` is called instead. In both methods the `WWW www` object contains all relevant information regarding the request. For more information on the `WWW` class please read the [Unity documentation](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WWW.html).

To use your extended version of the `Tributit.Callback` interface (let's say you called it `MyCallback`), you need to include this line of code in the place in your project's code, where you wish to track the **event**:

```
Tributit.Tributit.Track(game_token, player_token, new MyCallback());
```
